# Frontend Changes

**Note**: This implementation focused on backend code quality tools as no significant frontend code was found in the repository. The project appears to be primarily a Python backend application serving a web interface.

## Changes Made

### Code Quality Tools Added
1. **Black** - Automatic Python code formatting
2. **isort** - Import sorting with Black compatibility
3. **flake8** - Code linting and style checking

### Configuration Files Updated
1. **pyproject.toml** - Added quality tool dependencies and configuration
   - Added black, flake8, and isort dependencies
   - Configured Black settings (line length: 88, target Python 3.12+)
   - Configured isort to work with Black profile

### Scripts Created
1. **scripts/quality.sh** - Comprehensive quality check script
   - Runs formatting checks
   - Performs linting with flake8
   - Executes tests if available
   - Provides colored output with status indicators

2. **scripts/format.sh** - Code formatting only script
   - Runs Black formatter
   - Sorts imports with isort
   - Quick formatting without linting

3. **scripts/fix-lint.sh** - Auto-fix common linting issues
   - Removes unused imports (when autoflake available)
   - Applies formatting
   - Sorts imports

### Code Formatting Applied
- Applied Black formatting to all Python files in the backend
- Sorted imports throughout the codebase
- Improved code consistency and readability

### Documentation Updated
- Updated CLAUDE.md with new quality tool commands
- Added section explaining how to use the quality scripts
- Included manual command references

## How to Use

```bash
# Run all quality checks
./scripts/quality.sh

# Format code only
./scripts/format.sh

# Auto-fix common issues
./scripts/fix-lint.sh
```

## Benefits
- Consistent code formatting across the project
- Automated quality checks in development workflow
- Easy-to-use scripts for maintaining code quality
- Better code readability and maintainability
